# Coding Challenges - Go

I wanted to do some fun challenges to help learn [Go](https://go.dev).
Thankfully John Crickett created [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi).
This website has a collection of useful projects to create.
Each project lives within its own directory within this repo.
